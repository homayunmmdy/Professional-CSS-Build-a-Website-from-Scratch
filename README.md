### ðŸŽ¯ About the Course

This course focuses on building a responsive, accessible, and production-ready website using **pure CSS** , without relying on utility libraries or frameworks like Tailwind. Taught by CSS expert Kevin Powell, the course dives into modern best practices, custom properties (CSS variables), responsive layouts, and component-based structuring, all done from scratch.

Key concepts covered:

* CSS custom properties and scalable design tokens
* Flexbox and Grid layouts
* Responsive design strategies using `clamp()`, media queries, and fluid typography
* Writing maintainable, semantic HTML and CSS
* Accessibility fundamentals
* Deployment of a fully custom-built website

### ðŸ’¡ Why I Took This Course

You won't always be working with Tailwind CSS or utility frameworks , especially in older codebases or projects with custom styling requirements. Although Iâ€™ve used CSS for years and am familiar with most foundational concepts, I took this course to **sharpen my raw CSS skills** and explore **modern techniques in a framework-free environment**.

Seeing Kevin build and structure a fully responsive and elegant project from scratch was incredibly valuable. His approach reinforced the importance and power of pure CSS , reminding me how much can be accomplished without external libraries. This course was **insightful, practical, and absolutely worth revisiting**, even for developers already experienced in CSS.
